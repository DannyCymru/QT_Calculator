QT Programmer Calculator
========================

Function: 
---------

Normal mathmatical functions of a calculator and to convert numbers to the binary, hex or octal numbering systems.

Description/Background information
----------------------------------

Version 1
---------

This was originally the GUI build of the decimal converter found here: https://gitlab.com/ErebusC/small_projects/tree/master/cpp_projects/Decimal_converter. While creating this program however I decided to add standard mathmatical operations to increase its functionality, in doing so I also decided to create a GUI program that does not closely relate to that project. 

Version 2
---------

Version 2 is my second attempt at making a GUI calculator. It was created mainly for an assignment I had in my Event Driven Program class in college. Because of this I had to add some features that may appear slightly unnecessary for this type of application.

To Do List
----------

-[x] Completed Task -[ ] Incomplete Task

-[x] Add a form for "advanced view".  

-[x] Add more advanced mathematical operations

-[x] Add conversion to binary, hex, octal.

~~-[] Add math operations with binary numbers.~~

~~-[] Add keyboard functionality.~~

-[x] Add View" items to the menu bar. 

As this code is very old and quite outdated I have decided to officially call this project completed. There is too much tech debt involved for this project for me to do more changes without major refactoring and I feel that my programming efforts are best spent elsewhere.
