QT Programmer Calculator
========================

Function: 
---------

Normal mathmatical functions of a calculator and to convert numbers to the binary, hex or octal numbering systems.

Description/Background information
----------------------------------

This was originally the GUI build of the decimal converter found here: https://gitlab.com/ErebusC/small_projects/tree/master/cpp_projects/Decimal_converter. While creating this program however I decided to add standard mathmatical operations to increase its functionality, in doing so I created a GUI program that does not closely relate to that project.
